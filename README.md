# Singapore Autonomous Underwater Vehicle Challenge (SAUVC)Autonomous-Underwater-Vehicle

The repo consisits of scripts written for an AUV that can successfully maneuver underwater for the Singapore
Autonomous Underwater Vehicle Challenge. We calibrated multiple sensors like barometer and gyrometer and programmed a raspberry-pi to
control the thrusters based on the information received from these sensors for this project.
